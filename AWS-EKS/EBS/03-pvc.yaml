  name: ebs-pvc                             # Name of the PVC
spec:
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteOnce                         # EBS volumes support only single-node access
  storageClassName: ebs-sc                  # References the StorageClass defined earlier
  resources:
    requests:
      storage: 5Gi                          # Request 5 GiB of EBS-backed persistent storage

# Notes:
# - ReadWriteOnce (RWO) is the only supported access mode for AWS EBS â€” a volume can be mounted by only one node at a time.
# - The storageClassName must match your StorageClass (e.g., ebs-sc from 02-ebs-storage-class.yaml).
# - Once this PVC is applied, Kubernetes dynamically provisions and binds an EBS volume to it using the CSI driver.
